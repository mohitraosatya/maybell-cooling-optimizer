# Termite-Inspired Passive Cryogenic Cooling Simulation 

This project simulates a nature-inspired thermal optimization framework for quantum computing environments — specifically dilution refrigerators like those built by **Maybell Quantum**.

## Why Should Maybell Care?

Quantum systems require ultra-low temperatures to maintain qubit stability. Current dilution refrigerators rely heavily on active cryo-cooling, which:
- Increases energy demands
- Adds complexity and maintenance overhead
- Has limited passive fallback in case of failure

Inspired by **termite mounds**, which regulate temperature via passive airflow channels, this project explores the idea of integrating **passive vent-like structures** into cryogenic hardware to:

-Enhance thermal uniformity  
-Provide graceful recovery in cryo failure scenarios  
-Reduce overall energy consumption with minimal design changes  

## What This Project Shows

- 2D heat diffusion model simulating quantum cooling environments  
- Realistic material layers: copper, aluminum, insulation  
- Simulated cryo failure at runtime  
- Optimization of vent layouts for best passive performance  
- Visual graphs showing center temperature stability over time  

## Potential Impact

> A low-cost, nature-inspired addition to dilution refrigerators that increases system resilience, energy efficiency, and design innovation — all aligned with Maybell Quantum’s mission of “cooling more with less.”
